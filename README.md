# NEAT-implementation

-> This document is based on the famous research paper by [Kenneth O. Stanley, 2002](nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf)

The project is based on research paper by NEAT by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen. This approach to solving complex problems represents an alternative to statistical techniques that attempt to estimate the ‘value’ of particular actions during a particular state of the world.
NEAT is unique because structures become increasingly more complex as they become more optimal, strengthening the analogy between GAs and natural evolution.
