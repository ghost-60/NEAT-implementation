# NEAT-implementation

-> This document is based on the famous research paper by [Kenneth O. Stanley, 2002](nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf)

The project is based on research paper by NEAT by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen. This approach to solving complex problems represents an alternative to statistical techniques that attempt to estimate the ‘value’ of particular actions during a particular state of the world.
  * Project aims at optimizing the neural network topology to achieve best possible result in minimal topology. 
  * Written in Lua script which  works on MarIO and takes almost 24 hours to perfect a single level.
  * The program works on Bizhawk emulator and could be possibly scaled to a number of different games.


## Requirements
You will need the following to run the above:
  * Bizhawk Emulator
  * SNES file for Super Mario World(USA)
